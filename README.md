Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Analysis Project

Project Overview:
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are unwanted or harmful effects caused by medications. This project aims to analyze ADR data to identify trends, potential risks, and drug safety concerns. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we can gain insights into how different drugs impact patients and improve pharmacovigilance.

Objectives:

Identify patterns and trends in ADR occurrences.
Detect the most commonly reported adverse reactions for different drugs.
Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, location) in relation to ADR frequency.
Visualize ADR data using interactive dashboards for better decision-making.

Dataset:

adverse_drug_reactions_data.
drug_information_data.
patient_demographics_data.
Contains attributes such as patient ID, drug name, reaction type, severity, demographics, and reporting date.

Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
